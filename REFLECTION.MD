Dear Codaisseur, dear Jeroen, dear Matias,

First of all, I MADE IT!!! :)!!! (I assume).

I was seriously doubting this a few times during my course. AND I'm starting to enjoy it more and more each day. I'm so happy!

So yes, I think my assessment went well :) I'm starting to feel confident in what I'm doing, and more important, did not stress out! Although the start was hard for me, but by Wednesday evening I got things going.

Looking back at the two weeks before the assessment, I approachecd things differently, by putting less emphasis on the reader, and more on the lectures. In particular the examples giving in the lectures. After each lectures, I went through the whole code by myself, and tried to really understand every bit, the code itself and the proces. I Made notes and changes. Tried things out. So practised way more, and as a result I have whole database of examples now, that really help me if I stuck or don't now how to approach things.

I"m seriously understanding filter now, thanx to David. Who was willing to explain me iterators for 3 times.

And special thanx to Jeroen, who is always there for me when I want to throw my computer, and myself, out of the window (figurally speaking).

The only thing, I keep having troubles with, is how to acces, an array of objects, within an array. I would like to talk about this in the next coming weeks. To use the data in this array. In section 4 I ran into this problem again. I fetched artworks and bids together, since they are related, and then you only have to fetch once. But then I don't know how to get the amount out of bids, and sort this.

Thank you for your time and speak to you guys soon.
